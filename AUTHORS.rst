``characteristic`` is written and maintained by `Hynek Schlawack <https://hynek.me/>`_.

The development is kindly supported by `Variomedia AG <https://www.variomedia.de/>`_.

It’s inspired by Twisted’s `FancyEqMixin <http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.python.util.FancyEqMixin.html>`_ but is implemented using class decorators because `sub-classing is bad for you <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MNVP9-hglc>`_, m’kay?


The following folks helped forming ``characteristic`` into what it is now:

- `Glyph <https://github.com/glyph>`_
- `Itamar Turner-Trauring <https://github.com/itamarst>`_
- `Jean-Paul Calderone <https://github.com/exarkun>`_
